# UploadAndSyncWithOrderId Component

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

The `UploadAndSyncWithOrderId` React component is designed for a workflow that allows users to:

1. **Select a category/channel** (e.g., "Return" or "New").
2. **Upload a CSV file** containing order or inventory data.
3. **Parse and validate the CSV data** using PapaParse.
4. **Send the parsed orders to a backend API** (`https://fastapi.qurvii.com/sync-orders`) to synchronize them.
5. **Generate tag PDFs** using the returned order data via the `TagPDFGenerator` component.
